## My Process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3 (including Flexbox)
- Bootstrap 5
- JavaScript (Bootstrap JS)

### What I Learned

During the completion of this project, I learned how to create a responsive QR code component using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. I gained experience in structuring content, applying responsive design principles, and incorporating third-party libraries.

Here's an example of code where I customized the QR code container:

```css
.qr-code {
    background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
    width: 100%;
    height: auto;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    padding: 10vh 0;
    box-shadow: 0 5px 15px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
}
```

## Continued Development

In future projects, I aim to further enhance my skills in JavaScript and explore advanced CSS techniques. Additionally, I plan to focus on improving my understanding of front-end frameworks such as React and Vue.js.

## Resources

While working on this challenge, I found the following resources to be particularly helpful:

- **Bootstrap Documentation** - Comprehensive guide to using Bootstrap for responsive design.
- **Frontend Mentor Community** - Engaging discussions and solutions from fellow developers.
